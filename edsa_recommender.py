Using this type of movie recommendation system, we require the title of the movie as input, but our sim_matrix is based on the index of each movie. Therefore, to build this, we need to convert movie title into movie index and movie index into movie title. Let's create functions which operate those functions.")

SVD can also be used in least squares linear regression, image compression, and denoising data.')
